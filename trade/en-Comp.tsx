      Grid strategy is a powerful tool that can capitalize on market
      fluctuations within a predetermined price range. A grid strategy sets
      multiple buy and sell orders to automatically buy low and sell high for
      profit. If you want to learn how to create a custom grid, please refer to{' '}

      Maximum grid strategy value per user eligible for calculating share of
      prize pool is limited to $<b>5000</b>.
    </>
  ),
  'campaign.grid2401_faq_1_res': (
    <>
      The total prize pool is 21,000 USDC, with 3,000 USDC distributed every 24
      hours, for a total of 7 distributions.
      <br /> <br />
      Following the start of event, the system will settle accounts every 24
      hours and distribute the daily prize pool to eligible grid strategies
      according to their weight. The weight calculation is derived from the
      value of the grid strategy and the duration in minutes of the grid created
      that day.
      <br /> <br />
      The value of the grid strategy is determined by the initial value when the
      grid is set up and does not change with price fluctuations. Each user has
      a participating fund limit of $5000 for the grid strategy boost. Users can
      establish multiple eligible grid strategies from the same address during
      the activity, but the total eligible funds is capped at $5000.
      <br /> <br />
      For example: There are only two users participating in the grid strategy
      event. At the 24-hour settlement mark, User A has set up a grid strategy
      worth $2,500 lasting 500 minutes, and User B has set up a grid strategy
      worth $6,000 lasting 1,000 minutes. If 3,000 USDC is distributed that day,
      then the weight ratio of A to B is: (2,500 x 500) / (5,000 x 1,000) = 1:4,
      meaning A receives 600 USDC, and B receives 2,400 USDC.
